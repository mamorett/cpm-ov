##  Overview

The cpm-ov project is an open-source AI-powered image-to-text generation tool that leverages the MiniCPM-o model to generate text based on input images. The core problem it solves is the lack of accessibility for people with visual impairments, as they may not be able to read or understand images. The project's key features include the ability to generate text based on any image, customizable prompts, and a user-friendly interface.

The target audience for this project includes individuals who are visually impaired or have difficulty reading images, as well as those who want to explore the capabilities of AI-powered image generation. The project's benefits include improved accessibility, increased efficiency in information retrieval, and a new way of consuming and interacting with visual content.

Overall, the cpm-ov project is an innovative solution that leverages AI to improve accessibility and provide new ways of interacting with images. Its open-source nature allows for collaboration and customization, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of users.
